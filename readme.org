** Todos
*** GENNERAL
    do as much as possible at runtime. best to just create one or two
    structs at compile time, that transport compile time information
    to the runtime.

*** COMMANDS
    commands are taken by @Command on methods
*** FLAGS

    Flags are special options. always true or false, but you do not
    have to give this as parameter. simply quoting the flag is
    enough. As they always default to false.

**** DONE parse long flags
**** TODO parse short flags
