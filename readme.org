** Usage

Dli is used by extending the class Dli. The resulting commandline is
craeted by tagging each member of the class that should contribute to
the commandline with @Option or @Task.

** Tasks

Every method tagged with @Task is exposed to the commandline. The
names of the methods arguments are used to fine tune the tasks.

e.g. for a commandline like

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./git test --interactive --verbose=3
#+END_SRC

your method would be called like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC d
test(string interactive/* with "true" */, string verbose/* with "3" */);
#+END_SRC

The 'help' task is already predefined in Dli, so every program should
have sinsible help.

** Options

Options are always written as --name=value. If value is left out, the
value true is assumed.

There are two kinds of options.

*** Global Options

Are used when every task can work with the same option (e.g. verbose).

Those are given on the commandline before the command.

*** Local Options

Those are only sensible for one of the tasks. On the commandline those
come after the task.

** Todos

*** Subtasks
*** Short versions for options and tasks
